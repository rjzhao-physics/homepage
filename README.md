I am a research fellow at Nanjing Normal University. I received my Ph.D. in Chemical Physics from the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Dr. John D. Weeks](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jdw/). Prior to that, I worked on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics at Iowa State University, advised by [Dr. James W. Evans](https://www.ameslab.gov/directory/james-evans). My current research focuses on elastic metastability of nanomechanical systems coupled to thermalizing environments, with emphasis on applying free energy approaches, enhanced sampling methods, and generalized transition state theory to these systems.
