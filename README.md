I am a research fellow in physics at Nanjing Normal University. I received my Ph.D. in Chemical Physics from the [Institute for Physical Science and Technology](https://ipst.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Dr. John D. Weeks](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jdw/). Prior to that, I worked on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of surfaces at Iowa State University and Ames National Laboratory, advised by [Dr. James W. Evans](https://www.ameslab.gov/directory/james-evans). My current research focuses on nonequilibrium physics of nanomechanical systems coupled to thermalizing environments; in a separate line of work, I study molecular magnetism.

## Research Interests
- Thermally activated transitions in elastic nanostructures
- Thermalization of anisotropic molecular magnets
